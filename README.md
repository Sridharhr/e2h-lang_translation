# dl-language-translation

### About
Neural network machine translation using a sequence to sequence model on a dataset of English and French sentences. 

### Data

* Small portion of English and French corpus is in the `data/` subdirectory
* For more vocabulary train on the [WMT10 French-English corpus](http://www.statmt.org/wmt10/training-giga-fren.tar) with a GPU (and once the network is performing well on the limited dataset)

### Code
`code.ipynb` (Jupyter notebook)

* Implements encoder-decoer RNN using tensorflow `seq2seq`

### Testing

* Testing and output for both datasets is inline in the notebook
