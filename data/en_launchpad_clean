unable to store a value at key s as the configuration server has no writable databases there are some common causes of this problem your configuration path file s path doesn t contain any databases or wasn t found somehow we mistakenly created two processes your operating system is misconfigured so file locking doesn t work your home directory or your client machine crashed and didn t properly notify the server on reboot that file locks should be dropped if you have two processes or had two at the time the second was launched logging out killing all copies of and logging back may help if you have stale locks remove gconf lock perhaps the problem is that you attempted to use from two machines at once and still has its default configuration that prevents remote connections put orbiiopipv etc orbitrc as always check the user for details on problems encountered there can only be one per home directory and it must own a lockfile gconfd and also lockfiles individual storage locations such as gconf .

general notes on re edit th march jaminday removed some unnecessary sentences to reduce verbosity and streamline tried to avoid any references to it being a manual as we have tried to move away from this term within the document removed early references to linux in the prologue before reader gets to section on linux we are trying to target this at new users who may not initally connect linux with ubuntu moved contact details and info on contacting re any changes etc to end of prologue not sure if there was a reason for this being earlier but felt to me like it broke the flow of the document removed comparison of unix to ms windows e g originating long before ms windows this sounds like marketing talk and is unnecessary need review of changes to last section is ubuntu right for you .

in this case the certificate has not been verified by a third party that your computer trusts anyone can create a certificate claiming to be whatever website they choose which is why it must be verified by a trusted third party without that verification the identity information in the certificate is meaningless it is therefore not possible to verify that you are communicating with domain instead of an attacker who generated his own certificate claiming to be domain you should not proceed past this point .

you can see some cards but you can t see what s on the other side of them each card is hiding an adding up sum or the answer to the sum an adding up sum looks like this the numbers on one side of the equals sign have to be the same as the number on the other side so and more makes count aloud when you work this out and count on your fingers because the more ways you do something the better you remember it you can also use blocks or buttons or anything you can count if you have lots of brothers and sisters you can count them or the kids in your class at school sing counting songs count lots of things for practice and you ll be very good at adding up in this game these cards are hiding the two parts of an adding up sum also called an addition sum you need to find the two parts of the sum and bring them together again click on a card to see what number it s hiding then try to find the other card that goes with it to make a whole sum you can only turn over two cards in one go so you need to remember where the numbers are hiding then you can match them when you find their other half you re doing the job of the equals sign and the numbers need you to put them together and make a proper sum when you do that both those cards disappear when you ve made them all disappear found all the sums you ve won the game .

you may however wish to scan your email for viruses in case you happen to forward a virus from one person to another for example if one of your friends has a windows computer with a virus and sends you a virus infected email and you then forward that email to another friend with a windows computer then the second friend might get the virus too you could install an anti virus application to scan your emails to prevent this but it s unlikely to happen and most people using windows and mac os have anti virus software of their own anyway .

for a certificate which has not expired the issuer of that certificate is responsible for maintaining something called a revocation list if a certificate is ever compromised the issuer can revoke it by adding it to the revocation list and then this certificate will no longer be trusted by your browser revocation status is not required to be maintained for expired certificates so while this certificate used to be valid for the website you re visiting at this point it is not possible to determine whether the certificate was compromised and subsequently revoked or whether it remains secure as such it is impossible to tell whether you re communicating with the legitimate website or whether the certificate was compromised and is now in the possession of an attacker with whom you are communicating .

in this case the address listed in the certificate does not match the address of the website your browser tried to go to one possible reason for this is that your communications are being intercepted by an attacker who is presenting a certificate for a different website which would cause a mismatch another possible reason is that the server is set up to return the same certificate for multiple websites including the one you are attempting to visit even though that certificate is not valid for all of those websites can say for sure that you reached strong domain strong but cannot verify that that is the same site as strong domain strong which you intended to reach if you proceed chrome will not check for any further name mismatches in general it is best not to proceed past this point .

at the beginning of the game four seeds are placed in each house players take turns moving the seeds in each turn a player chooses one of the six houses under his or her control the player removes all seeds from this house and distributes them dropping one in each house counter clockwise from the original house in a process called sowing seeds are not distributed into the end scoring houses nor into the house drawn from that is the starting house is left empty if it contained seeds it is skipped and the twelfth seed is placed in the next house after a turn if the last seed was placed into an opponent s house and brought its total to two or three all the seeds in that house are captured and placed in the player s scoring house or set aside if the board has no scoring houses if the previous to last seed also brought the total seeds in an opponent s house to two or three these are captured as well and so on however if a move would capture all an opponent s seeds the capture is forfeited and the seeds are instead left on the board since this would prevent the opponent from continuing the game the proscription against capturing all an opponent s seeds is related to a more general idea that one ought to make a move that allows the opponent to continue playing if an opponent s houses are all empty the current player must make a move that gives the opponent seeds if no such move is possible the current player captures all seeds in his her own territory ending the game source wikipedia http en wikipedia org wiki oware .

in this case the address listed in the certificate does not match the address of the website your browser tried to go to one possible reason for this is that your communications are being intercepted by an attacker who is presenting a certificate for a different website which would cause a mismatch another possible reason is that the server is set up to return the same certificate for multiple websites including the one you are attempting to visit even though that certificate is not valid for all of those websites chromium can say for sure that you reached strong domain strong but cannot verify that that is the same site as strong domain strong which you intended to reach if you proceed chromium will not check for any further name mismatches .
